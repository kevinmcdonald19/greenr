<!-- ****************** QUESTION CONFIRMATION AREA ****************** -->

<div class="content_title">Families</div>
<div class="content_body">Family of origin is an important starting point for each couple. When one marries, he/she is marrying into the other person's family system. The task of each person upon entering marriage is to separate from one's own family of origin, while still remaining connected. To not separate is to make it impossible to create the marital union. At the same time, to cut off from one's family of origin is to threaten the marital relationship with too much pressure and intensity. It is important for both parties to go into marriage with an understanding of their own family background, as well as insight regarding their prospective marriage partner's family of origin.</div>
<div class="content_title">Roles in Marriage</div>
<div class="content_body">Roles in marriage are still critical even in the 21st century. Given the changes in gender-based roles, it is easy to dismiss the idea that there are set roles within a marriage. But this is not necessarily true, nor does it need to be true. What is critical is how the couple sees it. If they both agree on who will cut the grass, who will handle the checking account, who will address the various tasks of their home, then all is good. This section is partially about the mutual giving and receiving within the relationship. There must be a sense of equity for both the husband and wife. They can form a more traditional style or they can adopt a style that appeals to them. But, it cannot be assumed.</div>
<div class="content_title">Budget & Finances</div>
<div class="content_body">Finances are often the last talked about topic within a serious relationship. It can even be a topic with a lot of emotional tension that one or both parties bring into the relationship for various reasons. One may be a saver while the other is a spender. They might have accumulated some financial assets before they are married or they may have accumulated debt they are bringing into the marriage. All this needs to get addressed. This section helps the couple speak openly and honestly about their finances. Budgets can be very formal or informal. Regardless of how they choose to deal with their finances they need to be responsible.</div>
<div class="content_title">Values</div>
<div class="content_body">Making their relationship primary is a value that will be essential for a healthy and strong marriage. Hopefully the couple holds many similar values. Even where they have some dissimilar values, there will need to be some deepening appreciation for how the other party holds a particular value. The ideal is that they attempt to make such values into "our values" - meaning, the one who may value doing some charity or outreach, would be joined by their partner in such an endeavor. At the least, the other partner would support him or her, even if they do not see it as such a high value. In return the partner who is now getting support can express true appreciation for their partner's efforts.</div>
<div class="content_title">Habits</div>
<div class="content_body">Habits covers a wide range of items. It might mean an occasional burp, or it could mean road rage. Some habits are destructive and will cause a marriage to crumble. This section has to do with having both parties go into the marriage with their eyes wide open. Too often a person will reason that a destructive habit, such as drug or alcohol abuse will go away once the couple marries. Love will conquer all. This is faulty thinking - magical thinking. In all probability it will only get worse. Counseling and other treatment programs are available and need to be considered if habits that are currently exhibited by one or both of the partners.</div>
<div class="content_title">Work & Family</div>
<div class="content_body">Most of us are swamped with many things and we need to take responsibility for setting a healthy balance and making sure we keep the marriage as our top priority. Eventually there may be children, jobs, or other things that can come between the couple. It is up to the couple to take responsibility for how they will handle the various life obligations that will be an ongoing part of their relationship. Many engaged and newly married couples report that even before marriage they have trouble balancing "together time" with the many other time-consuming activities in their lives.</div>
<div class="content_title">Friendship & Leisure</div>
<div class="content_body">Couples do not suddenly end the friendships they had prior to becoming involved with each other. They eventually find that they begin to develop mutual friends hopefully including some married friend couples. Ideally, they are to become each other's best friend. All those other friendships have their place but the marital relationship needs to take priority. This does not mean that they are not to have any other friends. In fact, friendships can and often do support the marital relationship. In order for this to be a positive benefit to the marriage, they will need to set some boundaries so that friendships remain supportive without becoming a distraction or even temptation for the marital relationship.</div>
<div class="content_title">Sexuality & Intimacy</div>
<div class="content_body">This section addresses the bonding power of sexual love and how a couple can enter into a life-long commitment to build their relationship into a deepening and lasting one through intimacy and the gift of their sexuality. They must also pay attention to the intentional development of emotional, intellectual, and spiritual intimacy. Each dimension of a couple's intimacy connects with the others. So, if one is neglected, all parts of the relationship can suffer, including the physical expression of love. Studies report that couples that are passionate about each other can more easily solve problems that arise.</div>
<div class="content_title">Commitment</div>
<div class="content_body">Too many movies, love songs, and TV shows reflect the notion that love is a feeling rather than a decision. This section has to do with choosing to love even when it might be difficult. Commitment is an agreement or a pledge to do something in the future, even when we may or may not feel like doing so. We act according to our agreement. Marriage represents such a commitment. We decide to love, with or without the loving feelings. What we also know about such a pledge is that when we do act based upon one's commitment we can create an atmosphere where the positive and loving feelings can more likely flourish.</div>
<div class="content_title">Communication</div>
<div class="content_body">The importance of Communication is a given, but in reality, it is a never-ending task, an important skill that the couple must continually work on throughout their marriage. This section addresses the basic starting point of this couple's level of communication, but this is only the beginning; they must desire to increase in their capacity to communicate masterfully. Active listening, speaking "I" messages, and all the ways that they have available to them are more than simple skills. In marriage the couple has the possibility of helping each other heal their own childhood wounds, and in doing so become intimate and more in love than they can ever imagine.</div>
<div class="content_title">Parenting</div>
<div class="content_body">Deciding to have children is the largest decision a couple can make, and when it happens, can lead to the largest adjustment within a marriage. In some sense it makes the marital adjustment pale in comparison. The adjustment to time, money, household tasks, and to the couple's time together shifts in dramatic ways. This section has the couple discussing the realities of their own relationship and what it entails or will entail. When to have children is often a major decision they must make. If the couple runs into any issues during this process, another entire set of decisions and adjustments must be made. Their own family of origin can often factor into these decisions.</div>
<div class="content_title">Faith, Religion & Spirituality</div>
<div class="content_body">Just as one's physical self opens up to the other in marriage, so too does one's spirituality open up to the other. In this section the engaged couple looks at where they are presently regarding their own spirituality and religious faith, as well as practice. Each couple is a mixed marriage of sorts, regardless of what their circumstances may be. This section takes them wherever they are and asks them to investigate how they might move into a spiritual intimacy, via prayer, rituals and practices â€” formal and informal.</div>
<div class="content_title">Catholicism</div>
<div class="content_body">Even two practicing Catholics are not necessarily at the same place in their spiritual journey. This section asks the couple to look at their marriage, given that at least one is Catholic, and therefore having their marriage in the Catholic Church. It is important that they look at this as something each is freely choosing and that it requires from each one a basic understanding about what Catholics really believe, and what they especially believe regarding Catholic/Christian marriage.</div>
