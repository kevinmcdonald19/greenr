    <div class="content_title">Families</div>
    <div class="content_body">Family of origin is an important starting point for each couple. When one marries, he/she
        is marrying into the other person's family system. The task of each person upon entering marriage is to separate
        from one's own family of origin, while still remaining connected. To not separate is to make it impossible to
        create the marital union. At the same time, to cut off from one's family of origin is to threaten the marital
        relationship with too much pressure and intensity. It is important for both parties to go into marriage with an
        understanding of their own family background, as well as insight regarding their prospective marriage partner's
        family of origin.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Roles in Marriage</div>
    <div class="content_body">Roles in marriage are still critical even in the 21st century. Given the changes in
        gender-based roles, it is easy to dismiss the idea that there are set roles within a marriage. But this is not
        necessarily true, nor does it need to be true. What is critical is how the couple sees it. If they both agree on
        who will cut the grass, who will handle the checking account, who will address the various tasks of their home,
        then all is good. This section is partially about the mutual giving and receiving within the relationship. There
        must be a sense of equity for both the husband and wife. They can form a more traditional style or they can
        adopt a style that appeals to them. But, it cannot be assumed.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Budget & Finances</div>
    <div class="content_body">Finances are often the last talked about topic within a serious relationship. It can even
        be a topic with a lot of emotional tension that one or both parties bring into the relationship for various
        reasons. One may be a saver while the other is a spender. They might have accumulated some financial assets
        before they are married or they may have accumulated debt they are bringing into the marriage. All this needs to
        get addressed. This section helps the couple speak openly and honestly about their finances. Budgets can be very
        formal or informal. Regardless of how they choose to deal with their finances they need to be responsible.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Values</div>
    <div class="content_body">Making their relationship primary is a value that will be essential for a healthy and
        strong marriage. Hopefully the couple holds many similar values. Even where they have some dissimilar values,
        there will need to be some deepening appreciation for how the other party holds a particular value. The ideal is
        that they attempt to make such values into "our values" - meaning, the one who may value doing some charity or
        outreach, would be joined by their partner in such an endeavor. At the least, the other partner would support
        him or her, even if they do not see it as such a high value. In return the partner who is now getting support
        can express true appreciation for their partner's efforts.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Habits</div>
    <div class="content_body">Habits covers a wide range of items. It might mean an occasional burp, or it could mean
        road rage. Some habits are destructive and will cause a marriage to crumble. This section has to do with having
        both parties go into the marriage with their eyes wide open. Too often a person will reason that a destructive
        habit, such as drug or alcohol abuse will go away once the couple marries. Love will conquer all. This is faulty
        thinking - magical thinking. In all probability it will only get worse. Counseling and other treatment programs
        are available and need to be considered if habits that are currently exhibited by one or both of the partners.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Work & Family</div>
    <div class="content_body">Most of us are swamped with many things and we need to take responsibility for setting a
        healthy balance and making sure we keep the marriage as our top priority. Eventually there may be children,
        jobs, or other things that can come between the couple. It is up to the couple to take responsibility for how
        they will handle the various life obligations that will be an ongoing part of their relationship. Many engaged
        and newly married couples report that even before marriage they have trouble balancing "together time" with the
        many other time-consuming activities in their lives.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Friendship & Leisure</div>
    <div class="content_body">Couples do not suddenly end the friendships they had prior to becoming involved with each
        other. They eventually find that they begin to develop mutual friends hopefully including some married friend
        couples. Ideally, they are to become each other's best friend. All those other friendships have their place but
        the marital relationship needs to take priority. This does not mean that they are not to have any other friends.
        In fact, friendships can and often do support the marital relationship. In order for this to be a positive
        benefit to the marriage, they will need to set some boundaries so that friendships remain supportive without
        becoming a distraction or even temptation for the marital relationship.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Sexuality & Intimacy</div>
    <div class="content_body">This section addresses the bonding power of sexual love and how a couple can enter into a
        life-long commitment to build their relationship into a deepening and lasting one through intimacy and the gift
        of their sexuality. They must also pay attention to the intentional development of emotional, intellectual, and
        spiritual intimacy. Each dimension of a couple's intimacy connects with the others. So, if one is neglected, all
        parts of the relationship can suffer, including the physical expression of love. Studies report that couples
        that are passionate about each other can more easily solve problems that arise.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Commitment</div>
    <div class="content_body">Too many movies, love songs, and TV shows reflect the notion that love is a feeling rather
        than a decision. This section has to do with choosing to love even when it might be difficult. Commitment is an
        agreement or a pledge to do something in the future, even when we may or may not feel like doing so. We act
        according to our agreement. Marriage represents such a commitment. We decide to love, with or without the loving
        feelings. What we also know about such a pledge is that when we do act based upon one's commitment we can create
        an atmosphere where the positive and loving feelings can more likely flourish.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Communication</div>
    <div class="content_body">The importance of Communication is a given, but in reality, it is a never-ending task, an
        important skill that the couple must continually work on throughout their marriage. This section addresses the
        basic starting point of this couple's level of communication, but this is only the beginning; they must desire
        to increase in their capacity to communicate masterfully. Active listening, speaking "I" messages, and all the
        ways that they have available to them are more than simple skills. In marriage the couple has the possibility of
        helping each other heal their own childhood wounds, and in doing so become intimate and more in love than they
        can ever imagine.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Parenting</div>
    <div class="content_body">Deciding to have children is the largest decision a couple can make, and when it happens,
        can lead to the largest adjustment within a marriage. In some sense it makes the marital adjustment pale in
        comparison. The adjustment to time, money, household tasks, and to the couple's time together shifts in dramatic
        ways. This section has the couple discussing the realities of their own relationship and what it entails or will
        entail. When to have children is often a major decision they must make. If the couple runs into any issues
        during this process, another entire set of decisions and adjustments must be made. Their own family of origin
        can often factor into these decisions.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Faith, Religion & Spirituality</div>
    <div class="content_body">Just as one's physical self opens up to the other in marriage, so too does one's
        spirituality open up to the other. In this section the engaged couple looks at where they are presently
        regarding their own spirituality and religious faith, as well as practice. Each couple is a mixed marriage of
        sorts, regardless of what their circumstances may be. This section takes them wherever they are and asks them to
        investigate how they might move into a spiritual intimacy, via prayer, rituals and practices â€” formal and
        informal.
    </div>
    <div class="content_title">Catholicism</div>
    <div class="content_body">Even two practicing Catholics are not necessarily at the same place in their spiritual
        journey. This section asks the couple to look at their marriage, given that at least one is Catholic, and
        therefore having their marriage in the Catholic Church. It is important that they look at this as something each
        is freely choosing and that it requires from each one a basic understanding about what Catholics really believe,
        and what they especially believe regarding Catholic/Christian marriage.
